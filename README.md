## What It Does

This plugin connects [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) to [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/), exposing your wearable data as **AI-callable tools**. Once installed, the DeepSeek agent can automatically query your activities, sleep, steps, and heart rate to provide personalized fitness insights — all through natural language.

### Registered Tools

The plugin registers **10 tools**. Eight return Garmin data without writing;
`download_garmin_activity_fit` writes one local file on the MCP/dsh host, and
`create_garmin_workout` changes the user's Garmin workout library.

| Tool | Description | Example Args |
|---|---|---|
| `get_garmin_activities` | Fetch recent activities (runs, rides, swims…) with compact or full detail | `{"limit": 5, "detail": "compact"}` |
| `get_garmin_sleep` | Sleep score, duration, and stage breakdown for a date or range | `{"startDate": "2023-10-01", "endDate": "2023-10-02"}` |
| `get_garmin_steps` | Step totals for a date or range; goal/distance appear only when Garmin supplies them | `{"startDate": "2023-10-01"}` |
| `get_garmin_heart_rate` | Resting, max, and min heart rate for a date or range | `{"startDate": "2023-10-01", "endDate": "2023-10-02"}` |
| `get_garmin_weight` | Body composition (weight, BMI, body fat %, muscle mass, etc.) for a date or range | `{"startDate": "2023-10-01"}` |
| `get_garmin_workouts` | Workout templates from your Garmin workout library (not calendar scheduling) | `{"limit": 10, "offset": 0}` |
| `get_garmin_profile` | User profile summary | `{}` or omit |
| `get_running_skill_advice` | Explain 8 workout types and 4 training philosophies, or collect the mandatory intake for personalized coaching | `{"mode": "explain", "query": "Daniels", "language": "en"}` |
| `download_garmin_activity_fit` | Download an activity's original archive and safely extract its single FIT file to the account directory under the configured host parent | `{"activityId": 123456789}` |
| `create_garmin_workout` | Preview a structured workout; create it only after explicit confirmation | `{"name": "Threshold 3×8min", "steps": [...]}` |

Workout creation is a two-call flow. The preview response includes a one-time
`confirmationId`; after the user approves the unchanged preview, call the tool
again with the same definition, `confirmed: true`, and that `confirmationId`.
An ID expires after 10 minutes and cannot be reused.

### Personalized running coaching

`get_running_skill_advice` deliberately separates explanation from planning:

- `mode: "explain"` explains a workout type or training philosophy. It does not
  invent an athlete-specific schedule.
- `mode: "personalized"` is required for any recommendation or plan. Before it
  returns planning material, the tool requires answers for all six intake areas
  below. Missing answers are returned as focused questions; Garmin activity data
  is not fetched and a schedule must not be generated yet.

| Intake field | What the assistant must ask |
|---|---|
| `goal` | Target distance/event, future ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` date, and completion or ideal/minimum time goal |
| `currentPerformance` + `performanceBasis` | A representative race/time trial from the past two years, result, non-future date, effort/conditions, or an explicit `no_recent_benchmark` |
| `trainingBackground` | Running history and recent 4–8 week volume, frequency, long run, quality work, and interruptions |
| `availability` | Available days/time, fixed rest and long-run days, terrain/facility limits, strength-training time, and whether double days are possible |
| `healthConstraints` + `hasWarningSymptoms` | Current/past-year injury, pain, relevant disease/medication, sleep and recovery, plus an explicit warning-symptom boolean |
| `trainingPreference` + preference details | `steady`, `hard_easy`, or `mixed`, plus `maxQualitySessionsPerWeek` (0–7) and `intensityGuidancePreference` (`pace`, `heart_rate`, `rpe`, or `mixed`) |

If `hasWarningSymptoms` is true—for example current chest discomfort,
unusual breathlessness with mild activity, fainting/dizziness, or abnormal
palpitations—the tool returns a safety stop without workout material or Garmin
activity access. It advises medical clearance and does not diagnose. If
`performanceBasis` is `no_recent_benchmark`, planning material instructs the
assistant to begin with easy base work or a low-risk benchmark instead of
inventing precise threshold or interval paces.

The compact philosophy layer contains:

- **Hansons** — frequent, more evenly distributed mileage, pace discipline, and
  cumulative fatigue; its 16-mile long run is not a standalone prescription.
- **Jack Daniels** — derive VDOT and E/M/T/I/R intensity from current, recent
  performance, never from the goal time.
- **Norwegian threshold** — borrow controlled, non-exhaustive threshold work and
  hard/easy separation; double-threshold days are not prescribed by default.
- **Polarized training** — keep most work genuinely easy and a small amount
  clearly hard; 80/20 is a direction rather than an exact quota.

Recent Garmin runs may supplement this intake but never replace the athlete's
answers. The method notes and evidence boundaries are summarized in
[the training-method research note](https://github.com/Likenttt/garmin-connect-plugin-for-dsh/blob/main/docs/research/running-training-methods.md).
Each philosophy and workout-card output labels its statements as
`system_principle`, `research_evidence`, or `application_inference` so a method
definition or coaching inference is not misrepresented as comparative proof.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install this plugin — from the npm registry (recommended)

```bash
npx --legacy-peer-deps=false @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-plugin-garmin-connect
```

This single command installs the dependency **and** activates the plugin layer — the first run automatically initializes the `web` profile. You only need `pnpm` on your `PATH`:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

> `--legacy-peer-deps=false` makes npm resolve peer dependencies normally. If your npm config has `legacy-peer-deps=true` (it skips peer packages), dsh would fail to boot with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package '@deepseek-ai/cordis-plugin-group'`. On machines without that setting the flag is a harmless no-op.

Verify the plugin layer is composed without booting:

```bash
npx --legacy-peer-deps=false @deepseek-ai/dsh --profile web --dump-config | grep -A 2 garmin-connect
```

Other install sources:

```bash
# Local checkout (development)
cd garmin-connect-plugin-for-dsh && npm install
npx --legacy-peer-deps=false @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add .

# GitHub source install
npx --legacy-peer-deps=false @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add github:<owner>/<repo>
```

### 2. Install the Harness CLI (if you haven't already)

```bash
npx --legacy-peer-deps=false @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

The web UI starts at `http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default. If you launch Harness via `npx`, keep using the same prefix for the commands below (`npx --legacy-peer-deps=false @deepseek-ai/dsh …`); if you have `dsh` installed globally, you can drop the `npx @deepseek-ai/` prefix.

### 3. Configure Credentials

Normal runtime credentials come from environment variables (or a secret store
provided by your launcher); keep `.env` out of version control. The experimental
local Web flow is the narrow exception: after explicit profile confirmation, the
Host atomically saves an owner-only DI session file. It never saves the password,
MFA code, or CAPTCHA response.

```bash
# Source checkout only: copy the bundled template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and fill in your Garmin credentials
```

For a registry installation, create `.env` directly in the directory where you
run `dsh` (your workspace root), then add the variables from the table below;
the package's template is inside the installed dependency rather than your
current directory. The plugin loads the workspace `.env` automatically.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GARMIN_USERNAME` | ✅ | Your Garmin account email |
| `GARMIN_PASSWORD` | ✅* | Legacy direct-login password; do not use this for the interactive MFA setup below |
| `GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN` | ✅* | Inline pre-authenticated token (supported, but the session file is safer) |
| `GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN_FILE` | ✅* | Path to the owner-only DI v2 (or compatible legacy OAuth) session file generated by the local auth command |
| `GARMIN_REGION` | ❌ | `global` (default) or `cn` for Garmin China |
| `GARMIN_FIT_DOWNLOAD_DIR` | FIT only | User-selected host parent directory for FIT exports; no default. The generated account directory includes `GARMIN_REGION` |
| `GARMIN_CACHE_TTL` | ❌ | Cache duration in seconds (default: `300`) |
| `GARMIN_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | ❌ | Garmin request timeout in milliseconds (default: `15000`) |
| `GARMIN_LOG_LEVEL` | ❌ | `debug` \| `info` \| `warn` \| `error` |
| `GARMIN_ACTIVITY_DETAIL` | ❌ | `compact` (default) or `full` (expanded fitness plus precise route/location fields; credentials and account/social identifiers are filtered) |

> \* You need one of `GARMIN_PASSWORD`, `GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN`, or
> `GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN_FILE`. A protected file is safer than an inline token,
> especially when isolating multiple processes; this does not make the unfinished
> MFA bootstrap a supported workflow. If more than one is configured, the inline token takes
> precedence over the file, and a valid session takes precedence over password
> login.
>
> ⚠️ If your password contains `#` or other special characters, wrap it in **double quotes** — otherwise `#` and everything after it will be treated as a comment:
> ```
> GARMIN_PASSWORD="my#secret!pass"
> ```
>
> `GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN` and the contents of `GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN_FILE` are as
> sensitive as a password. Token export is intentionally not AI-callable; never
> paste a token into an AI conversation.

#### Two-step verification — experimental local dsh preview

When dsh and its Web UI are running together on the same local machine, use the
**Garmin Login** entry in the top bar. It opens a custom bridge on an ephemeral
`127.0.0.1` port; that bridge, rather than the dsh page itself, embeds Garmin's
official GAuth page. Email, password, MFA code, and any CAPTCHA are entered only
inside the Garmin iframe.

Garmin sends its short-lived service ticket only to the isolated loopback bridge.
The bridge validates the expected region, message origin, iframe source, service,
and ticket, then immediately hands it to the plugin Host for the region-bound DI
token exchange. The Host probes the Garmin profile, shows a sanitized profile to
the user for confirmation, and only then atomically saves an owner-only session
bound to the configured account and region. The outer dsh page receives only
public progress states: the dsh page, model context, and AI-callable tool results
never receive the ticket, DI token, password, MFA code, or CAPTCHA response.

This Web flow is intentionally limited to the loopback dsh Web UI. It is not a
remote, hosted, or tunneled login endpoint. Browser third-party-cookie and iframe
policies can prevent Garmin GAuth from completing, and final end-to-end testing
with a real MFA account has not yet been completed. Treat it as experimental,
not as a completed authentication capability.

The isolated-browser command below remains the fallback for development and
diagnosis. It is likewise not a supported 0.1.5 authentication path. Run it
yourself in a trusted local terminal from this source checkout and select the
account's region explicitly:

```bash
# Garmin International
npm run auth:setup -- --browser --account personal --region global

# Garmin China
npm run auth:setup -- --browser --account personal --region cn
```

`auth:setup` is the source-checkout npm-script alias. The stable executable name
for an installed package is `garmin-connect-auth`, so Codex, Claude Code, and
other local clients can all point users to the same bootstrap command:

```bash
garmin-connect-auth --help
garmin-connect-auth login --browser --account personal --region global
garmin-connect-auth login --browser --account personal --region cn
```

Direct invocation requires an installation that places npm executables on
`PATH`, normally a global install; a nested dsh dependency or an ordinary local
dependency does not do that. Install the published executable globally, or use
the package directly with `npx`:

```bash
npm install -g dsh-plugin-garmin-connect@0.1.5
npx -y --package dsh-plugin-garmin-connect@0.1.5 \
  garmin-connect-auth login --browser --account personal --region global
```

For a source checkout, `npm install -g .` or
`npm run auth:setup -- --browser ...` remains available. In every form, the
command opens an isolated, visible system Google Chrome context. Enter the
email, password, MFA code, and any CAPTCHA only on Garmin's page; the CLI does
not read those form values, and none may be supplied through flags, environment
variables, MCP tool arguments, or model input.

After the browser closes, the CLI exchanges the short-lived service ticket and
probes Garmin's region-bound DI profile endpoint. The local terminal then shows
a sanitized Garmin profile label beside the requested account alias and
configured username. Type exactly `yes` only if they identify the intended
account. Any other answer cancels the write. A successful confirmation writes
an owner-only DI v2 session and prints its path; Codex, Claude Code, the model,
and other agents must never read or copy the session contents or credentials.

The legacy terminal flow without `--browser` remains available for
compatibility. It reads hidden password/MFA input in the local terminal, but it
cannot reliably complete browser-only challenges such as CAPTCHA and is not a
supported two-step-verification solution.

For troubleshooting the same browser/DI path without creating credentials,
this checkout also includes a deliberately non-persisting diagnostic:

```bash
# Choose the account's region explicitly.
npm run auth:canary -- --region global
npm run auth:canary -- --region cn
```

The experimental canary opens an isolated, visible system Google Chrome
context. Enter email, password, MFA, or CAPTCHA only on Garmin's page. The CLI
does not read those form values; it captures one short-lived service ticket,
immediately closes the temporary browser, then performs one region-bound DI
token exchange and verifies the profile API. It does not save cookies, tokens,
screenshots, traces, video, HAR, or a session file. A passing canary provides
partial diagnostic evidence only; 0.1.5 does not provide a supported
browser-MFA session-creation workflow.

The canary requires system Google Chrome plus the optional `playwright-core`
driver installed by a normal dependency install. If dependencies were installed
with `--omit=optional`, the canary is unavailable; normal login, dsh, and MCP
operation remain unaffected.

The unfinished setup command is designed to save only a DI v2 session after
browser login and explicit profile confirmation, then print its path. On POSIX
it uses owner-only mode `0600`;
on Windows it uses the current user's config directory but does not yet validate
Windows ACLs. It does not save the password or MFA code. Configure the runtime
with the printed path, then omit `GARMIN_PASSWORD`:

```dotenv
GARMIN_USERNAME=your-email@example.com
GARMIN_REGION=global
GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN_FILE=/absolute/path/to/personal.session.json
GARMIN_FIT_DOWNLOAD_DIR=/absolute/path/to/garmin-fit-parent
```

DI v2 files bind the normalized username, region, and probed Garmin profile via
one-way hashes, including `profileIdHash`; they do not duplicate the plaintext
email in the binding. The runtime rejects username, region, or profile mismatch
before publishing refreshed credentials. It refreshes access tokens before
expiry, persists a rotated refresh token before using the new session, and may
retry an authentication failure at most once for an idempotent GET. Workout and
other write requests are never replayed automatically.

For backward compatibility, legacy session files containing only the two
`oauth1` and `oauth2` fields are still accepted. They have no profile binding;
the intended replacement is a validated DI v2 session with the mismatch guard,
but neither the experimental dsh Web bridge nor the unfinished CLI browser
command is yet a release-supported way to generate one.
On POSIX, a legacy file must still pass the current owner-only file-permission
check (normally mode `0600`).

On POSIX, the default account directory is created with owner-only permissions. To choose
a different session file, add `--output /absolute/private/path/personal.session.json`.
On POSIX systems, an existing parent directory must grant no permissions to
group or other users (normally mode `0700`); a missing parent is created
owner-only. The command refuses an unsafe parent instead of weakening it.

The fallback CLI bootstrap uses Garmin's private SSO/DI flow and is unfinished. On
2026-08-21, a real China-region browser login produced a short-lived service
ticket and the DI exchange/profile probe was verified separately. The current
browser interception can leave the redirected Garmin page at
`ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`, and the complete capture → exchange → confirmed
session write → dsh/MCP restart/refresh path has not been revalidated end to
end. The Global-region browser path is also unverified. These commands remain a
developer preview and are not part of the supported 0.1.5 feature set. The new
dsh loopback bridge avoids depending on that redirected completion page, but it
has not yet completed final end-to-end testing with a real MFA account either.

#### Multiple accounts: one isolated process per account

The supported runtime model is one account per process and one independently
initialized session per process. Give each dsh, Codex, Claude Code, or other MCP
process its own `GARMIN_USERNAME`, `GARMIN_REGION`, and
`GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN_FILE`. Neither experimental browser bootstrap can yet be
relied on to create those sessions for MFA accounts.

Do not copy one session file to another process, and do not let simultaneous
processes share one file. Garmin refresh tokens may rotate; concurrent writers
can otherwise invalidate or overwrite each other's credentials. For example,
use aliases such as `personal-dsh`, `personal-codex`, and `personal-claude`, with
an independently initialized session for each one. Do not point another runtime
at the same file through a symbolic link or a differently cased path alias.

The processes may share one `GARMIN_FIT_DOWNLOAD_DIR` parent: the plugin creates
a separate account subdirectory from each configured region and email. This also
keeps `cn` and `global` accounts with the same email from colliding. For example,
name the servers `garmin-personal` and `garmin-family` and select the intended
server in the request.

This is process isolation, not an in-process account selector or a multi-tenant
authorization system. Do not expose one shared MCP process to mutually
untrusted users; per-user access control has not been implemented. Switching
accounts inside one conversation and automatic cross-account sync remain on the
roadmap.

#### FIT downloads

`download_garmin_activity_fit` accepts only an activity ID; the model cannot
choose an arbitrary output path. Garmin's original activity ZIP is downloaded
to a private temporary location, size-checked, and required to contain exactly
one valid FIT file. Given a configured parent directory `<base>`, the result is
written as `<base>/GARMIN_FIT_<cn|global>_<normalized-email>/<activityId>.fit` without
overwriting an existing file. The `cn` or `global` component comes from
`GARMIN_REGION`. Here `<normalized-email>` is derived safely from the configured
email: a normal email address
remains recognizable, while path separators, control characters, and other
unsafe filename characters are normalized before the account directory is
created. The user locates the file from the configured parent plus this rule.
The tool returns only `activityId`, `fileName`, `sizeBytes`, and `sha256`; it does
not return the parent, account directory, email, or full path. ZIP/FIT bytes
never enter model context.

The parent directory has no default and must be chosen explicitly through
`GARMIN_FIT_DOWNLOAD_DIR`. It is required only when using this tool; if unset,
the tool fails before writing any file and all other Garmin tools remain
available. Multiple account processes can safely share the same parent because
their region-and-normalized-email subdirectories are isolated, including when
the same email is used for both Garmin China and Garmin International.
Existing `GARMIN_FIT_<email>` directories are not migrated automatically; new
downloads use the region-prefixed directory while old files remain in place.

Garmin's “original” export is not guaranteed to be FIT. If the archive has no
single valid FIT entry, the tool fails safely instead of renaming another
format.

### 4. Run

```bash
npx --legacy-peer-deps=false @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3080`. The plugin is loaded when **Settings → Plugins → Plugin list** shows `plugin-garmin-connect` as *mounted & enabled*. Then try: *"How was my sleep last night?"* or *"Show me my last 5 runs."*

### 5. Integration Test (optional, source checkout only)

The integration script is a development aid and is not included in the npm
tarball. From a source checkout with development dependencies installed, you
can run it after configuring `.env`:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

The script checks read-only APIs and exits non-zero if any check fails. It does
not create, update, or delete workouts or other Garmin data.

By default it hides the account identifier and prints only counts/status, not
activity or health values. Set `GARMIN_INTEGRATION_VERBOSE=true` only when you
explicitly want normalized details in your local terminal output.

## Security

> **Credentials are used locally to authenticate directly with Garmin Connect
> and are never returned by an AI tool.**

### Credential Resolution Order

```
1. Plugin config values (set on the plugin row in a profile patch / `--patch` overlay)
   ↓ fallback
2. Environment variables (.env / shell)
   ↓ fallback
3. Schema defaults
```

### Best Practices

| Practice | Status |
|---|---|
| Environment-variable and secret-marked configuration are supported | ✅ |
| `.env` is in `.gitignore` | ✅ |
| Account identifier and credentials marked with `role('secret')` in Cordis schema | ✅ |
| Local dsh Web MFA bridge | ⚠️ Experimental; loopback only, real-account MFA E2E still pending |
| CLI `--browser` MFA fallback | ⚠️ Unfinished developer preview; not supported for 0.1.5 |
| DI v2 sessions bind username, region, and `profileIdHash`; legacy two-field sessions remain compatible | ✅ |
| Independently initialized per-process session files support isolated multi-account setups | ✅ |
| Access refresh is preemptive; idempotent GET replay is limited to once and writes are never replayed | ✅ |
| Tool outputs never include raw credentials | ✅ |
| FIT bytes and local/account paths stay on the host; the model receives only activity/file name/size/hash | ✅ |
| In-memory cache reduces API calls (rate-limit protection) | ✅ |

### Session Tokens

Session-token authentication remains supported, but tokens are credentials and
must not appear in agent output or trajectory logs. For that reason this plugin
does not expose authentication, MFA submission, or token export as AI-callable
tools. If you already have a validated owner-only DI v2 or compatible legacy
session file, dsh/MCP can read it through `GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN_FILE`; the
runtime does not need the account password. The DI file binds normalized
username and region as well as `profileIdHash`; legacy unbound
`oauth1`/`oauth2` files remain readable for compatibility. Creating a new MFA
session through the dsh Web bridge or browser commands above remains
experimental and is not yet release-supported. Because Garmin
refresh tokens may rotate, never concurrently share or copy one session file
across dsh, Codex, Claude Code, or other processes.

---

## Use with Other AI Coding Agents (MCP)

This plugin also ships as a standalone **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server**, so you can use the same Garmin tools with OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, WorkBuddy, ZCode, and any other MCP-compatible client — no DeepSeek Harness required.

> **Current availability:** the standalone MCP entry point is included in npm
> `0.1.5` and later. A local checkout remains useful for development.

Build the local server first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Likenttt/garmin-connect-plugin-for-dsh.git
cd garmin-connect-plugin-for-dsh
npm install
npm run build
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/garmin-connect-plugin-for-dsh` in the examples with
the checkout's actual absolute path.

The following examples show how to wire an **already validated** session file
into an MCP client. They do not make the unfinished browser MFA bootstrap a
supported 0.1.5 workflow. Make the non-secret account/region plus the
session-file path and FIT parent directory available to the client process,
then replace these placeholders with absolute paths on your machine:

```bash
export GARMIN_USERNAME='your@email.com'
export GARMIN_REGION='global'
export GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN_FILE='/absolute/path/to/personal.session.json'
export GARMIN_FIT_DOWNLOAD_DIR='/absolute/path/to/garmin-fit-parent'
```

Do not put a password or MFA code in these variables. The MCP server never
prompts for MFA; it can only start from an existing valid session. Protect both the
session file and the FIT directory because downloaded activities may contain
precise location and health data. Each simultaneously running client process
needs a separately initialized session file; do not copy or concurrently share
one file across Codex, Claude Code, dsh, or another client.

### OpenAI Codex (app, CLI, and IDE extension)

Codex clients on the same host share `~/.codex/config.toml`. The recommended
setup forwards credential variable names from the environment instead of
copying their values into TOML. With the variables above available to the Codex
process, add this entry to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.garmin-connect]
command = "node"

# Read tools can run normally; Codex asks before local-file and Garmin writes.
default_tools_approval_mode = "writes"
```

This entry consumes a DI v2 session assigned only to this Codex process; Codex
never receives or prompts for the password/MFA code. Do not
reuse a session already assigned to dsh, Claude Code, or another running process.
For a second account, add another server table such as
`[mcp_servers.garmin-family]` and provide a distinct independently initialized
session file. It may reuse the same FIT parent directory; output is
automatically isolated under that account's region-and-normalized-email
subdirectory.

The Codex process must inherit the exported variables. If the desktop app was
launched outside that shell, add the server through **Settings → MCP servers**
and provide its environment there, or launch it through your usual secret-aware
environment. Values entered in Settings are local credentials; protect the
resulting configuration file.

For a trusted-project-only setup, put the same table in `.codex/config.toml`
inside that project. Restart the Codex client after editing the file, then
inspect the saved configuration:

```bash
codex mcp list
codex mcp get garmin-connect
```

Inside Codex CLI, use `/mcp` to verify that the server is active and inspect
its tools. The
[official Codex MCP documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp/)
also covers the Settings UI and `codex mcp add` command.

### Claude Code

Garmin is normally a personal server, so user scope is a good default. The
following bash/zsh example keeps the session contents out of `~/.claude.json`;
only the owner-only file path is configured:

```bash
claude mcp add-json --scope user garmin-connect \
  '{"type":"stdio","command":"node","args":["/absolute/path/to/garmin-connect-plugin-for-dsh/lib/mcp.js"],"env":{"GARMIN_USERNAME":"${GARMIN_USERNAME}","GARMIN_REGION":"${GARMIN_REGION:-global}","GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN_FILE":"${GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN_FILE}","GARMIN_FIT_DOWNLOAD_DIR":"${GARMIN_FIT_DOWNLOAD_DIR}"}}'
```

This server reads a DI v2 session assigned specifically to this Claude Code
process; Claude Code never receives or prompts for the password/MFA code.
Register a differently named server and provide a distinct independently
initialized session file for each additional process or account. Do not copy
another process's session. The servers may reuse the same FIT parent directory.

Use `--scope local` instead if the server should be available only in the
current project. Keep the path variables available whenever you launch Claude
Code, then verify the connection:

```bash
claude mcp get garmin-connect
claude mcp list
```

Inside Claude Code, `/mcp` shows connection status and the exposed tools. See
the [official Claude Code MCP documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp)
for scope and `.mcp.json` details. Do not commit personal Garmin credentials in
a project-scoped configuration.

### Using the tools in Codex or Claude Code

Once `garmin-connect` reports as connected, ask naturally; the client selects
the MCP tool. If tool selection is ambiguous, explicitly say “use the
garmin-connect MCP server.” For example:

- “Use garmin-connect to show my last five runs.”
- “Compare my sleep and resting heart rate over the last seven days.”
- “Download the FIT file for activity 123456789 under my configured Garmin FIT parent.”
- “Preview a threshold workout, show me the steps, and do not create it until I approve.”

Workout creation still follows the enforced two-call confirmation flow: the
first call only previews, and creation requires your approval plus the returned
one-time `confirmationId`.

### Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin-connect": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/garmin-connect-plugin-for-dsh/lib/mcp.js"],
      "env": {
        "GARMIN_USERNAME": "your@email.com",
        "GARMIN_REGION": "global",
        "GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN_FILE": "/absolute/path/to/personal.session.json",
        "GARMIN_FIT_DOWNLOAD_DIR": "/absolute/path/to/garmin-fit-parent"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. You'll see a 🔌 icon indicating the tools are loaded. Try: *"Show my last 5 runs"* or *"Preview a threshold workout"*.

### Cursor

Add the same `mcpServers.garmin-connect` object shown above to the workspace's
`.cursor/mcp.json`, using the absolute `lib/mcp.js` path.

### Windsurf

Open **Windsurf Settings → Cascade → MCP Servers**, or edit
`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`, and add the same
`mcpServers.garmin-connect` object shown above.

### WorkBuddy

WorkBuddy Desktop supports local MCP servers at user and project scope. For
personal Garmin data, prefer the user-level `~/.workbuddy/mcp.json`. Open
**Plugins → MCP Servers → Configure MCP**, or edit that file directly, and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin-connect": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/garmin-connect-plugin-for-dsh/lib/mcp.js"],
      "env": {
        "GARMIN_USERNAME": "your@email.com",
        "GARMIN_REGION": "global",
        "GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN_FILE": "/absolute/path/to/personal.session.json",
        "GARMIN_FIT_DOWNLOAD_DIR": "/absolute/path/to/garmin-fit-parent"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use `command -v node` on macOS/Linux or `where node` on Windows to find the
absolute Node.js executable; GUI applications may not inherit an `nvm` shell
path. In JSON on Windows, use forward slashes such as `C:/.../node.exe`, or
escape each backslash as `\\`. Leave out `type` in WorkBuddy's local-command
format. Save the file and confirm that the server status turns green, then start
with a read-only request. See the [official WorkBuddy MCP guide](https://www.codebuddy.cn/docs/workbuddy/From-Beginner-to-Expert-Guide/Function-Description/MCP-Guide).

The session file in this entry must be an independently initialized, validated
file; WorkBuddy never receives the password/MFA code. Add another named
`mcpServers` entry with a separate session file per account. Entries may share
the same FIT parent directory because region-and-email account subdirectories
are automatic.

### ZCode

Open **Settings → MCP Servers → New MCP Server**, choose **User** scope and
`stdio`, then enter the same absolute Node.js command, `lib/mcp.js` argument,
and Garmin environment variables. Alternatively, edit the native user config
at `~/.zcode/cli/config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "garmin-connect": {
        "command": "/absolute/path/to/node",
        "args": ["/absolute/path/to/garmin-connect-plugin-for-dsh/lib/mcp.js"],
        "env": {
          "GARMIN_USERNAME": "your@email.com",
          "GARMIN_REGION": "global",
          "GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN_FILE": "/absolute/path/to/personal.session.json",
          "GARMIN_FIT_DOWNLOAD_DIR": "/absolute/path/to/garmin-fit-parent"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

ZCode can also import an existing Codex or Claude Code MCP entry. Its generic
`~/.agents/mcp.json` support uses the `mcpServers` shape, but if the same scope's
`.zcode` config contains any MCP server, ZCode skips that `.agents` file rather
than merging it. See the [official ZCode MCP guide](https://zcode.z.ai/en/docs/mcp-services).

The session file in this entry must be an independently initialized, validated
file; ZCode never receives the password/MFA code. Add another named server with
a separate session file per account. Servers may share the same FIT parent
directory because region-and-email account subdirectories are automatic.

These configurations have been checked against both clients' published schemas;
an end-to-end WorkBuddy/ZCode smoke test with a real Garmin account has not yet
been recorded.

The Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, WorkBuddy, and ZCode JSON examples store
the sensitive session-file path in their client configuration, but not the
session contents, password, or MFA code. Restrict those files' permissions and
never commit them. The Codex and Claude Code examples forward path variables
instead. MCP results can place sleep, heart-rate, weight, activity, and location
data in the selected model's context; review that client's data controls and
keep activity detail at `compact` unless precise expanded data is necessary.
FIT bytes and the complete local/account path remain on the MCP host. Only the
activity ID, file name, size, and hash enter model context; locate the file
using your configured parent and the documented account-directory rule.

With npm `0.1.5` or later, the local `node …/lib/mcp.js` command can be replaced
with:

```bash
npx -y --package dsh-plugin-garmin-connect garmin-connect-mcp
```

### Manual Run

```bash
# Run the MCP server (stdin/stdout) with an existing validated session file
GARMIN_USERNAME=xxx \
GARMIN_SESSION_TOKEN_FILE=/absolute/path/to/personal.session.json \
GARMIN_FIT_DOWNLOAD_DIR=/absolute/path/to/garmin-fit-parent \
node lib/mcp.js
```

The MCP server exposes the same **10 tools and argument semantics** as the dsh
plugin: activities, sleep, steps, heart rate, weight, workout-library templates,
profile, running skills, local FIT download, and workout preview/creation.
Authentication, MFA submission, and session-token export are intentionally
unavailable through either AI interface.

## Publishing & Distribution

The package is a standard dsh bundle: `package.json` declares `dsh.bundle.patch` → `cordis.patch.yml`, and `files` ships the compiled `lib/`, `.env.example`, both READMEs, and the patch file.

```bash
npm run build   # prepublishOnly also runs this automatically
npm publish
```

After publishing, users install with a single command:

```bash
npx --legacy-peer-deps=false @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-plugin-garmin-connect
```

Distribution notes:

- **npm registry (recommended)** — the tarball ships prebuilt `lib/`, so no build permission is needed at install time.
- **Local checkout** — `npx --legacy-peer-deps=false @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add .` links the source directory; run `npm install` first.
- **GitHub installs** — `npx --legacy-peer-deps=false @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add github:<owner>/<repo>` fetches sources and runs the package's `prepare` script with the locally installed TypeScript compiler; pnpm ≥ 10 refuses to run the script until you allow it — `dsh` prints the exact `allowBuilds` key for the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- Add the `dsh-plugin` topic to your GitHub repository for discoverability.

## Roadmap

- [x] **Body Composition** — weight, BMI, body fat %
- [x] **Workout Library** — list reusable Garmin workout templates
- [x] **Workout Creation** — safely preview and create structured workout-library entries
- [x] **MCP Server** — use with Codex, Claude Code/Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, WorkBuddy, ZCode
- [x] **Running Coach** — 8 workout types, 4 training philosophies, and mandatory personalized intake
- [ ] **Browser MFA Bootstrap** — the loopback dsh bridge now embeds official Garmin GAuth and keeps credentials/tickets out of dsh and AI surfaces; finish real-MFA, DI v2 persistence, restart/refresh, third-party-cookie, and CN/Global end-to-end verification
- [x] **Process-isolated Accounts** — one independently initialized session file per dsh/MCP process; concurrent file sharing is unsupported
- [x] **FIT Download** — safely extract one FIT from the original archive into an automatic region-and-normalized-email subdirectory under a user-selected parent
- [ ] **Training Status** — VO2 Max, training load, recovery time
- [ ] **Single-process Account Registry** — run an isolated client, cache, limiter, and bound session for every configured account alias
  - [ ] `list_garmin_accounts` — list aliases, regions, and connection status without exposing email addresses, tokens, or session paths
  - [ ] Add an optional `account` argument to account-sensitive tools; require an explicit alias when no safe selection exists
  - [ ] `use_garmin_account` — select an account for one conversation when dsh exposes a trusted conversation identity
  - [ ] Fall back to passing the selected alias on every tool call; never use a process-global active account
  - [ ] Add per-user account allowlists before describing the feature as multi-tenant isolation
- [ ] **Multi-account Activity Sync** — copy activities in one explicit direction between CN and Global accounts
  - [ ] Preview the source, target, date range, candidates, duplicates, and privacy impact before any upload
  - [ ] Bind a short-lived, one-time confirmation to the exact account pair and immutable activity manifest
  - [ ] Stage and validate FIT privately, then upload once to the explicitly selected target; never delete the source
  - [ ] Persist a sync ledger for exact deduplication, restart recovery, and unknown upload outcomes; never blindly retry a timed-out POST
  - [ ] Add bounded batch jobs with `status`, `pause`, and `resume`
  - [ ] Add opt-in polling schedules for one-way automatic sync while dsh is running, with catch-up after restart
  - [ ] Keep bidirectional sync, automatic deletion, and full Garmin metadata mirroring out of the first release
- [ ] **Webhook / Push** — real-time activity upload notifications
- [ ] **OAuth 2.0** — migrate to official Garmin API when available for personal use
